# Conway's Game of Life

## Purpose

This repository contains an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The game is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## Current Implementation

The current implementation includes:
- An HTML5 canvas to display the game grid.
- JavaScript logic to handle the game rules and update the grid.
- CSS for basic styling of the canvas element.

### File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the canvas and includes the necessary scripts and styles.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that contains styles for the canvas and resets default browser styles.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic, including grid initialization, drawing, and updating.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-of-life-walkthrough.git
    ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the game in action.
